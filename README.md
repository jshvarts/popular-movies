### The Movie Db API Key is required.

In order for the Popular Movies app to function properly an API key for themoviedb.org must be included with the build.

You can obtain a key via the following [instructions](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api), and include the unique key for the build by adding the following line to
[USER_HOME]/.gradle/gradle.properties

`MyTheMovieDbApiKey="<UNIQUE_API_KEY">`
